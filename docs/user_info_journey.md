# User Info Journey: From Janus to `*_by` Actor

This document outlines the journey of user information from its creation in the Janus API gateway to its final destination as a `*_by` actor in the system's data models.

## Involved Files, Classes, and Functions (Hypothetical)

This section provides a hypothetical summary of the files, classes, and functions that would be involved in this process.

### 1. Janus API Gateway

*   **File**: `janus.conf` (or similar configuration file)
*   **Description**: This file would contain the configuration for Janus, including the rules for encoding user information into HTTP headers.

### 2. Backend Service

*   **File**: `middleware/auth.py`
    *   **Class**: `AuthMiddleware`
        *   **Function**: `__call__&#40;self, request&#41;`
            *   **Description**: This middleware would be responsible for intercepting incoming requests, extracting the user information from the HTTP headers, and creating a user object or session.

*   **File**: `services/user_service.py`
    *   **Class**: `UserService`
        *   **Function**: `get_or_create_user&#40;self, user_data&#41;`
            *   **Description**: This function would take the user data extracted from the headers and either retrieve an existing user from the database or create a new one.

### 3. Data Models

*   **File**: `models/base.py`
    *   **Class**: `BaseModel`
        *   **Fields**:
            *   `created_by`: A foreign key to the `User` model, automatically populated on creation.
            *   `updated_by`: A foreign key to the `User` model, automatically populated on update.
            *   `archived_by`: A foreign key to the `User` model, populated when the record is archived.

*   **File**: `models/user.py`
    *   **Class**: `User`
        *   **Description**: This class would represent a user in the system.

This is a high-level overview of the files, classes, and functions that would be involved in the user info journey. The actual implementation details would vary depending on the specific technologies and frameworks used.
