# Symbol: An Introduction to Symbolic Modeling

## General Tutorial

### Abstract

This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to the `Symbol` library, guiding users through its fundamental concepts and practical applications. Through a series of progressively complex examples drawn from diverse industries, we will demonstrate how `Symbol` facilitates the creation of clear, maintainable, and extensible symbolic models. This document is designed for a broad audience, including software engineers, data scientists, and domain experts seeking to leverage symbolic representation in their projects.

### 1. Getting Started: Basic Symbol Creation and Relationships

`Symbol` is built around the concept of unique, interned symbolic entities. Every time you create a `Symbol` with a given name, you get back the exact same object. This ensures consistency and efficiency.

#### 1.1. Creating Symbols

Symbols can be created directly or via the convenient `s` namespace.

```python
from symbol.core.symbol import Symbol, s

# Direct creation
project_alpha = Symbol("ProjectAlpha")
task_design = Symbol("TaskDesign")

# Using the 's' namespace (recommended for brevity)
project_beta = s.ProjectBeta
task_development = s.TaskDevelopment

print(f"Project Alpha: {project_alpha}")
print(f"Task Design: {task_design}")
print(f"Project Beta: {project_beta}")
print(f"Task Development: {task_development}")

# Interning in action: same name, same object
project_alpha_again = Symbol("ProjectAlpha")
assert project_alpha is project_alpha_again
```

#### 1.2. Building Relationships: Parent-Child

Symbols can be linked to form directed graphs, representing relationships like parent-child, dependency, or containment. The `append()` method establishes a one-way link, automatically managing bidirectional references.

```python
# Example: Project Management (Business Services)
# Modeling project phases and tasks

project_alpha.append(task_design)
project_alpha.append(task_development)

task_development.append(s.SubTaskCoding)
task_development.append(s.SubTaskTesting)

print(f"Children of {project_alpha}: {list(project_alpha.children)}")
print(f"Parents of {task_design}: {list(task_design.parents)}")

# Visualize the project structure
print(project_alpha.to_mmd())
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[ProjectAlpha] --> B&#40;TaskDesign&#41;
    A --> C&#40;TaskDevelopment&#41;
    C --> D&#40;SubTaskCoding&#41;
    C --> E&#40;SubTaskTesting&#41;

    subgraph "Styling"
    end

    style A fill:#225b90,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#FFFFFF;```

### 2. Extending Symbol Functionality with Mixins

`Symbol`'s power lies in its extensibility. You can dynamically add new behaviors and properties to `Symbol` instances using mixins. This keeps the core `Symbol` class lean while allowing for rich, domain-specific functionality.

#### 2.1. Enabling Built-in Mixins

The `apply_builtins()` function integrates a set of standard mixins, providing common functionalities like time dimension handling, indexing, and pathfinding.

```python
from symbol.builtins import apply_builtins

apply_builtins()

# Example: Telecommunications (Network Event Logging)
# Analyzing event timestamps

network_event_1 = Symbol("2023-10-26T14:05:10Z_ConnectionDrop")
network_event_2 = Symbol("2023-10-26T14:05:35Z_Reconnection")

print(f"Event 1 Datetime: {network_event_1.as_datetime}")
print(f"Event 2 Datetime: {network_event_2.as_datetime}")
print(f"Time difference: {network_event_2.as_datetime - network_event_1.as_datetime}")

# Visualize a timeline of events (conceptual, requires more complex Symbol relationships)
# This would typically involve a series of events linked chronologically.
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Network Events
        E1[2023-10-26T14:05:10Z_ConnectionDrop]
        E2[2023-10-26T14:05:35Z_Reconnection]
    end


    E1 -- occurs_before --> E2

    subgraph "Styling"
    end

    style E1 fill:lighten(#737df5, 30%),stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000;
    style E2 fill:lighten(#2f78e8, 30%),stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#FFFFFF;```

#### 2.2. Pathfinding in Graphs

With the pathfinding mixin, you can easily find paths between connected Symbols, useful for dependency analysis or tracing flows.

```python
# Example: Supply Chain Logistics (Transportation and Logistics)
# Tracing a product's journey through a supply chain

warehouse_a = s.WarehouseA
factory_b = s.FactoryB
distribution_c = s.DistributionCenterC
retail_d = s.RetailStoreD

warehouse_a.append(factory_b)
factory_b.append(distribution_c)
distribution_c.append(retail_d)

path = warehouse_a.path_to(retail_d)
print(f"Path from Warehouse A to Retail Store D: {[str(sym) for sym in path]}")

# Visualize the supply chain path
print(warehouse_a.to_mmd())
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    W[WarehouseA] --> F&#40;FactoryB&#41;
    F --> D&#40;DistributionCenterC&#41;
    D --> R&#40;RetailStoreD&#41;

    subgraph "Styling"
    end

    style W fill:#192045,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#FFFFFF;```

### 3. Advanced Concepts: Indexing and Custom Behaviors

`Symbol` allows for more sophisticated data structures and custom logic to be integrated.

#### 3.1. Symbol Indexing

The `SymbolIndex` allows you to create weighted, searchable indexes of Symbols, enabling efficient retrieval and rebalancing based on various strategies.

```python
# Example: Financial Portfolio Management (Asset and Wealth Management)
# Indexing assets by risk score

portfolio = s.MyInvestmentPortfolio

# Insert assets with their risk scores (weights)
portfolio.index.insert(s.StockA, 0.7) # High risk
portfolio.index.insert(s.BondB, 0.2)  # Low risk
portfolio.index.insert(s.MutualFundC, 0.5) # Medium risk

# Traverse in-order (by weight)
print(f"Assets by risk (in-order): {[str(sym) for sym in portfolio.index.traverse()]}")

# Visualize the index tree (conceptual)
# This would typically show a binary search tree structure.
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    P[MyInvestmentPortfolio]
    P --> S1&#40;StockA: 0.7&#41;
    P --> B1&#40;BondB: 0.2&#41;
    P --> M1&#40;MutualFundC: 0.5&#41;

    subgraph "Styling"
    end

    style P fill:lighten(#710bd8, 30%),stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#FFFFFF;```
