Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturers—especially **foundries** like TSMC or Samsung—operate through **multi-stage, tightly-controlled workflows**, blending *physics, chemistry, supply chain precision*, and *automated control systems*. These workflows can be organized into **8 major stages**, each with sub-processes.

I'll outline these workflows both **conceptually** and **visually**, with detailed Mermaid diagrams and context.

## 🏭 1. **Design Handoff**

(typically from a fabless company like AMD, Apple)

* Input: **GDSII** / **OASIS** layout file (tapeout)
* Validation: DRC/LVS (Design Rule & Layout vs. Schematic Checks)
* EDA tools used: Synopsys, Cadence, Siemens EDA

Creating the transistor layers (on the silicon wafer)

**Steps**:

* **Wafer cleaning & prep** (chemical scrub)
* **Ion implantation** (doping)
* **Oxidation** (SiO₂ layer formation)
* **Lithography** (EUV/DUV patterning)

* Dielectric deposition (e.g. SiOCH, SiN)
* **Dual-damascene** Cu metallization
* CMP to isolate layers
* Repeated for multi-layer metal stacks (10–20+ layers)
